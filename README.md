# Build-a-quiz-python
Write a program that:

1. Asks three questions to a user via the console
2. Verifies whether the answer is correct or not. If the answer is correct, you should print out: 
Good job! This is the right answer. Else, it should print out : Too bad! that is not the correct answer

3. We would rather like to ask again the same question if the answer was wrong. Using a while loop, 
make sure that the same question will be asked again when the answer was wrong.
4. We want to allow only 3 wrong answers (among all questions). If the user makes 3 wrong answers, 
the program should stop and print ("Too bad, you lost the game !")

The code has been tested in python 3
